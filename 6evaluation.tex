In our research, we focused on combining big data tools and techniques with advance analytic to detect the energy consumption patterns, facilitate in identifying the opportunities to improve energy efficiency and support decision making for planning and optimizing energy production an distribution.In this chapter we attempt to perform a critical analysis of our approach and results while highlighting some possible future research possibilities related directly or indirectly to our research.
